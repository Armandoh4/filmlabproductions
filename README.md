## CONTENTS

* [User Experience](#user-experience-ux)

A user deploying the Filmlab site will see my home (index.html) page. This includes a toggleable navigation bar, on mobile 

* [User Stories](#user-stories)

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

"I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few."

Filmlabs' final colour scheme is inspired by Netflix and their simple black and white website design. To replicate this I had to think about what my main 2 colours would be, with a third being complementary to the two

Originally, I had planned to use a primary color scheme of black; purple, and a accent of orange to outline important content. I also intended to use css to have a wave format for page seperation as seen here:

![Image of how the wave png would look](assets/readme_img/img2.png)



### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.

\sWhen working on Filmlab, I had issues with the javascript. Primarily with regards to adding a behind the scenes (bts.html) image carousel, with autoscroll dunctionality

Filmlab Productions (Filmlab) is a film website where Filmlab is able to post its content to its viewers. The site is used as a networking and video streaming platform. Also to reduce the bandwith load on servers, videos may be hosted on other streaming platforms, such as youtube. 

Main page -> index.html

The purpose of this page is to hold video content (trailers, short films & future releases) of my hobby film company "Filmlab Productions"

## Getting Started: Wireframing my project:

Initially I had a completely different idea for the website. I had intended on using waves on the top for the navigation, with a more colourised aesthetic on the about us page.
    
I then designed it on Figma with these as the results
    
## Color and Styling


My design was started on pencil and paper -> then moved to figma as a free tool that I would be able to see my design before committing to it in code.

Upon finishing the design it had 3 major issues:

 1) Color scheme -
 2) Media icons -
 3)

1- While commiting to the colour scheme, I wanted to remove elements that created visual noise, or affected readability for the user. I also wanted to cut down on colours outside of the primary colours (Grey & White)

### User Strories:

Investors who are lookinmg into the activities of the business.

* Investors
    As an investor I am looking for upcoming projects, the ability to see previous work, along with a description of who was involved.

    An investor would be most interested in the involvement of the producers in each project, along with their corresponding roles. This is easily accesible underneath the description of the film, where it describes.

    Note: -move to different section - fixes?
     while investors will have an inherant interest in contacting the company directly. To navigate to this section, there is one method. To go to the navigation bar, on the left. 
     
      This is easily accomplished through the "Contact us" hyperlink. However as this takes the user to another app, it has its flaws as a system

* Viewer
    As a viewer I am most interested in the films that Filmlab is creating. Navigation toward the films section is also therefore the most important feature for such a website. This would be the most important feature for a new company, looking to establish its audience

## Prerequisites to project:

Before starting my project I had had to understand the constraints of my project and the time limitations placed upon me. I would have a month and a half to design and develop my website.

- - -

## Testing



All content is made by me Armando Halilaj, support resources I have used are:
    - stack overflow (other people's questions - e.g. understanding the scaling aspect-ratio of the Iframes of my videos)
    - w3schools
    - Youtube (Grid & flexbox)



index.html (Filmlab - Homepage):
    HTML:
    CSS:






about.html (Filmlan - About):

    Bugs:

        I had no issues here until I ran into problems with the ".bubble" class. I tried to fix this by having the background wrap more closely with the text, and aligning content with flex to the center of the box. This had fixed one issue but also left all of the bubbles as the same size, as can be seen in the image below:

navbar ()
    HTML:
        All navbar information is located at the beggining of the body of each HTML folder. 
        
        
        When starting my project, my primary focus was on completing the navbar as it would be the most challenging part of my project. I would have to not only master the required media quiries to make it responsive on both mobile and desktop devices
        
        Initially I tried to make the navbar 
    CSS:




Reason for my commit being later in the project:
     Initially when I started writing the code for this website, it was during the start of the course. During this period I had not learnt about github and was spending half my time working through the cirriculum, the other half was getting practical experience by writing unique-code on a project I am passionate about. Since I only learnt how to use Git later on in the project, I would only know how to commit my code once I reached that part in the course.





Bugs:
    Along my journey I had experienced a great number of bugs and unintended consequences in the user experience. This ranged from elements which did not display at all, to elements covering the entirety of the screen: 

    
    Inconsitent text displays between films.html and the corresponding film pages:
